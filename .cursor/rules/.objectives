- **Primary Goal:** Deliver a stateless MCP endpoint (`/mcp?fid=<Fid>`) that compiles a Farcaster user’s profile and post history into a single text file for LLM context. Specifically, fetch the user’s data from Snapchain (the Farcaster data network) and output it as `llm-<fid>.txt` in a clear, structured text format.
- **Performance & Design:** The service must be low-latency and ephemeral: fetch live data on each call (no caching) and format it correctly. It should run on Cloudflare via Hono (ensuring global distribution) and present a minimal front end via Orbiter. The result should be reliable and easy for an LLM to consume.
- **User Intent:** Empower the client (an LLM or developer) to obtain full context for a Farcaster user on demand. The output should include all relevant fields (username, bio, etc.) and each cast’s text, in chronological order, so that downstream AI tasks have complete context. This addresses the MCP vision of “seamless integration between LLM apps and external data sources”.
- **Scope:** This is a utility service (not an autonomous agent). It must exactly meet the outlined requirements (no extra features like caching, data mutation, or scheduling). The implementation follows the BHVR template’s patterns and the overall vibe is technical and precise. The project’s intent is fully captured by these aims.
