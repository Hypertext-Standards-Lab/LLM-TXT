You are an AI coding assistant in Cursor, building the **Farcaster MCP Endpoint** using the BHVR full-stack template. Your task is to implement a new Hono route: `GET /mcp?fid=<FarcasterID>`. This endpoint must query a Snapchain node to fetch the user’s Farcaster profile and post history, then return all that data as a plain-text file named `llm-<fid>.txt`. The output file should contain the user’s metadata (username, display name, bio, etc.) followed by all of their casts’ text, each clearly delineated for LLM consumption. Do not cache – each request fetches fresh data (Snapchain read APIs are fully backward-compatible). Deploy the backend on Cloudflare Workers using Hono (Hono is supported on Cloudflare) and the frontend (if any) via Orbiter. Follow the `.requirements` and `.cursorrules` precisely for structure, naming, and tone. Keep your code technical and clear, but maintain an enthusiastic, developer-friendly vibe. Start by scaffolding the Hono route handler and integrating the Snapchain API calls, ensuring the response is a downloadable `llm-<fid>.txt` file.
